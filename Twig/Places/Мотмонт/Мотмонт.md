Mothmont turned out to be an interesting building.  Four stories with a steep, slanted shingle roof, it took up a third of a city block, it had no yard that I could make out.  The walls were eggshell pale, and the ivy that crawled across the brickwork was dark, almost leafless.  It wasn’t in an end of town I’d frequented, but even among nicer buildings with gargoyles that spat out water from the gutters and built-in stables for stitched horses, it stood out as something prominent.
The building formed a square, with the yard in the center, the precious pupils safe within.  A glass was erected with trees grown to support it at the corners, keeping those beneath dry.  The glass roof itself crawled with vines and small flowers.
